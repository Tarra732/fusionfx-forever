<pre><code># 📅 FusionFX 50-Year Autonomous Plan

## ⚡ Phase 1: Bootstrapping (2025-2026)
- Start with $300 on OANDA using 50x leverage
- Compound to $1.5M using London Breakout + AI fusion strategy
- Demo trade for 3 days, then go live June 26, 2025
- Withdraw to Binance every time profits exceed $10K

---

## 📈 Phase 2: Growth (2026-2030)
- Add new FX pairs automatically via StrategistAgent
- Activate Reinforcement Learning MetaController
- Deploy DAO Governor and Profit Vault
- Begin routing idle profits to DeFi protocols (AAVE, EigenLayer)

---

## 🔐 Phase 3: Resilience (2030-2040)
- Rotate Kyber-1024 quantum keys every 90 days
- Shard wallet secrets across Frankfurt, Singapore, and Arctic vaults
- Migrate from Hetzner to DePIN cloud (Akash, Render)
- Launch multi-agent voting DAO for upgrades

---

## 🌌 Phase 4: Legacy Mode (2040-2075+)
- Fully cloudless, redundant infrastructure
- Launch AI-to-AI trading modules for FX, crypto, commodities
- Store core trading logic on Arweave/IPFS for immutability
- Auto-retrain every 7 days using on-chain price data
- Transfer ownership to trust or DAO successor

---

## 🔒 Fail-Safes
- Dead man’s switch: if owner inactive for 1 year → DAO control
- Alert system via Telegram, SMS, and fallback cold storage
- Yearly MPC key rotation and backup validation
